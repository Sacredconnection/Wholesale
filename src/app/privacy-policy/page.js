      <EditorialSection id="cookies" number="04" title="Cookies and sessions">
        <p>
          Our website uses essential technology to maintain secure account sessions and provide requested features. For example, a secure session cookie may remember that an approved user has signed in. Disabling essential cookies can prevent account or ordering features from working correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If optional analytics, advertising, or preference cookies are introduced, we will provide any notice and choices required by applicable law. You can also manage cookies through your browser settings, although those controls may affect website functionality.

          <li>A successor or relevant counterparty in a legitimate merger, financing, restructuring, acquisition, or sale of business assets, subject to appropriate safeguards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not sell personal information for money. If an activity is legally treated as a “sale” or “sharing” in a particular jurisdiction, we will provide the notices and controls required there.
        </p>
      </EditorialSection>

      <EditorialSection id="retention-security" number="06" title="Retention and security">
        <p>
          We retain personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this policy, including order support, recordkeeping, dispute resolution, fraud prevention, and legal or accounting obligations. Retention periods vary according to the type of record and the law that applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative and technical measures designed to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, loss, or misuse. However, no internet transmission or storage system can be guaranteed completely secure. You are responsible for protecting your password and notifying us promptly if you suspect unauthorized account activity.

          Depending on your location, you may have the right to request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, or objection regarding your personal information. You may also be able to withdraw consent or appeal a decision about a privacy request.
        </p>
        <p>
          To protect your account, we may need to verify your identity before completing a request. Some information may be retained where permitted or required for legal, security, accounting, or contractual reasons. You may also have the right to contact your local data-protection authority.

      <EditorialSection id="international" number="08" title="International processing">
        <p>
          Because wholesale operations and service providers may be located in different countries, information can be processed outside the country where you live. Where required, we use recognized safeguards or another lawful mechanism intended to protect information during international transfers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our services are intended for business users and are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children through wholesale account registration.
